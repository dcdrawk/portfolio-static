Working with Autodesk Maya, we crafted everything from scratch to make a comical and memorable animation.</p>\n<md-divider class=\"margin-v\"></md-divider>\n<h4 class=\"md-title\">Process</h4>\n<p class=\"md-body-1\">Our animated short began with a series of simple sketches as we finalized our narrative. After, we collaborated together to model, texture, light, and animate our scene. After rendering each frame, we put on the final touches before presenting it to the class. Every model had to me made from scratch, and we put our knowledge of modeling and rigging to the test.</p>\n<md-divider class=\"margin-v\"></md-divider>\n<h4 class=\"md-title\">Result</h4>\n<p class=\"md-body-1\">The Sandwich was screened in front of the class and received an A. It was applauded for it's use of lighting, animation, and character rigging.</p>",

I settled upon Angular JS, and decided to make an app which followed Google's Material Design Specs. The first phase of development consisted of creating a working app that could track player stats and traits. The second phase included adding Google's Realtime API to allow groups of players to keep track of important adventure details.</p>\n<md-divider class=\"margin-v\"></md-divider>\n<h4 class=\"md-title\">Result</h4>\n<p>ScrollBinder successfully reimagined the DnD experience by bringing.

The goal was to take an app idea and create something completely unique and experimental. I decided to create an app that allowed users to roll 3D dice using unique gestures and movements. It requires a mobile phone with multi-touch or an accelerometer to use.</p>\n<md-divider class=\"margin-v\"></md-divider>\n<h4 class=\"md-title\">Process</h4>\n<p>We were given two weeks to reinvent an app with unique gestures. I decided to use threeJS and, physiJS libraries, which allowed me to create 3D objects complete with physics. My source of inspiration was the dice effect from the classic board game Trouble.</p>\n<md-divider class=\"margin-v\"></md-divider>\n<h4 class=\"md-title\">Result</h4>\n<p>This assignment was a true test of my JavaScript skills. After two weeks I had a working prototype that was able to use two different kinds of dice (d4 and d6). The dice can be rolled via a pinch gesture, or by moving the device up and down.</p>",
