    "intro" : "<p>I'm an avid web developer with a background in front end development, user experience, and design. I have a thirst for knowledge, a keen attention to detail, and I take pride in writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code. I enjoy being a part of teams both large and small to deliver feature-rich web apps and websites from conception to completion. Whether I’m creating a prototype from scratch or building large-scale web apps, I love what I do and I reflect that in my work.</p><p>During my academic and professional experience, I’ve honed my creativity and teamwork skills. I’m flexible, easy going, and I can easily adapt to new work environments. I like learning new techniques about the latest web technology, as well as sharing tips and tricks with colleagues and coworkers.</p>",
